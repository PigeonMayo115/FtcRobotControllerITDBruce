welcome!

This is the first iteration of what will be considered the main TeleOp program for the 2024-25
into the deep season. This is an updated version of the code that includes all basic functions of the robot
including drivetrain, wrist servo, intake, arm actuation, and arm elevation. The code right now is pretty messy,
but this is the first iteration of the program where I have made an attempt to condense it. I started with the
linear slides, so you can compare this program with the previous version called "ITDDualGamepadV2"
The logic for the linear slides is mostly done in the file "Lift", so for any confusion look there
good luck
p.s. I will do better commenting in future programs, I just wrote this one at like 9pm when I was exhausted
lacked time
